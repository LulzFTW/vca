            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><em><strong>Hi my name is Anton aka Paradise_Boy on the Internet and I am going to try and explain to who maybe concerned about why VoiceChatAlpha has come to an end.</strong></em>
                <br>
                <em><strong> First of all I got to say sorry to anyone who is trying to login and wondering why they can’t.</strong></em>
                <br>
                <em><strong> Back in late 2010 I wanted to start my own chat service so I could chat to my friends after Yahoo closed there chatrooms, so I told my brother I wanted to make a chat service.</strong></em>
                <br>
                <em><strong> My brother Peter Gransden aka PeeweeThe2nd on the Internet said he would help make the chat client and told me how he could take my chat client idea and take it to a hole new level, back then I thought this was a great idea and went ahead with it, little did I know what I was letting myself in for.</strong></em>
                <br>
                <em><strong> I thought that because Peter run his own company and made his own software, he could help me and guide me to success but again I was wrong.</strong></em>
                <br>
                <em><strong> I stupidly let Peter take over my project and type most of the VB6 code and I let him do things his way thinking he knew what he was on about, because of this I am now left with a project that is shit and does not work very well and I am left not knowing how to fix the problems and bugs.</strong></em>
                <br>
                <em><strong> Straight away I was getting warnings from his ex friends to not go ahead and work with Peter, lots of emails from his work friend David showing me emails of how Peter lives of his pension and never does any work, and from a good friend of mine telling how Peter said so many things but never done them and messed up peoples life along the way.</strong></em>
                <br>
                <em><strong> But stupid me thought it would never happen to me because peter is my brother and he wouldn’t do such a thing to me, but he did the same to me in the end.</strong></em></p>
            <p><em><strong>&nbsp;</strong></em></p>
            <p><em><strong>Peter Gransden is the owner of Paysoft.com&nbsp;<a href="http://payesoft.com/">http://payesoft.com/</a>&nbsp;he has told everyone in his life that he made the hole thing himself and is doing very well, always busy and earning a lot of money a year. The truth is that Peter did not make the paysoft program himself, he practically stole the source code of a man who’s marriage was going down, Peter put his name on the project source code and re wrote it in visual basic 6 witch is not hard to do.</strong></em>
                <br>
                <em><strong> A Man called Mike is the real owner of the source code and he was such a nice guy Peter knew how to take over his company and call it his own.</strong></em>
                <br>
                <em><strong> I found out these truths wile working with him on voicechatalpha and I soon found out how bad he was at coding as soon as we had to work with other programming languages, Peter only knows visual basic 6 an old windows programming language witch was a problem for voicechatalpha because we were stuck on windows only and there were so many problems with compatibility issues.</strong></em>
                <br>
                <em><strong> So Peter has lied about&nbsp;http://payesoft.com/, its not even his and didn’t do a lot to run the company and he lied about how well paysoft is really doing. Peter only gets about $8000 a Year for Paysoft witch is nothing and the only work he does do is an update of customers licences for the software.</strong></em>
                <br>
                <em><strong> So that’s about one weeks work in a hole Year !! Everyone has given peter money to live on out in the Philippians for so many years now and its time to stop, no more living of others and time to do some real work Peter.</strong></em>
                <br>
                <em><strong> All Peter Gransden did to create&nbsp;http://payesoft.com/&nbsp;is to take some one else’s source code and put his name on it. Paysoft is written in an old programming language called visual basic 6, know one codes in visual basic 6 anymore and know one uses&nbsp;<a href="http://payesoft.com/">http://payesoft.com/</a>&nbsp;anymore.</strong></em></p>
            <p><em><strong>&nbsp;</strong></em></p>
            <p><em><strong>I practically let my brother take over VoiceChatAlpha and destroy it.</strong></em>
                <br>
                <em><strong> Peter Gransden had been an alcoholic for about 20 years now and everyone who has tried to help him has been burnt, like me and my mum and so many others. Peter just takes and drinks himself to sleep. I should have known better because I was drinking hard to, I know that the drug alcohol gives you no conscience and I should of known better than to trust a drunk.</strong></em>
                <br>
                <em><strong> Peter would come into the chatrooms with all the kids there and shout out CUNT and NIGGER !!! and got the kids saying it to witch I always said was wrong and told him to stop so many times, I even closed the chat client when I knew he was drunk.</strong></em></p>
            <p><em><strong>&nbsp;</strong></em></p>
            <p><em><strong>I will never forgive my brother Peter Gransden for messing up a great idea/project of mine, like most alcoholics Peter will suffer because I think I am one of the last who give him the time of day, most people have blocked him on Facebook and most people ignore him because of the damage he has caused them in the past.</strong></em>
                <br>
                <em><strong> At this point in time Peter is in a very bad place in the Philippines and I feel sorry for his kids and girlfriend but even she will leave one day with the kids so there is hope for them.</strong></em></p>
            <p><em><strong>&nbsp;</strong></em></p>
            <p><em><strong>I am here by disowning my brother with the rest of my family. My family are all drug taking scrounging lairs who are fucked up in one way or another and I don’t want anything to do with them, I have done fine without them so far. Peter Gransden will die in a third world country alone with a bottle in his hand and that’s how it ends for alcoholics.</strong></em></p>
            <p><em><strong>BTW if you want to DdoS Peters software site for the Lulz then go to&nbsp;<a href="http://payesoft.com/webcalcuk.html">http://payesoft.com/webcalcuk.html</a>&nbsp;that’s his shit software and it runs on a XP VMware at his house on his shit internet connection.</strong></em>
                <br>
                <em><strong> Saying that though Peter has destroyed Paysoft a swell so it don’t matter what we do to it, its nearly dead anyway and Peter is to old and drunk to learn any new up to date programming languages.</strong></em>
                <br>
                <em><strong> O hold on MAYBE THAT’S WHY HES DRINKING LULZ.</strong></em></p>
            <p><em><strong>&nbsp;</strong></em></p>
            <p><em><strong>This has been a lesson learnt by me and I would advise anyone to be careful on who you invite into a project before starting one and if you want to make a program make it yourself.</strong></em>
                <br>
                <em><strong> All I can say is sorry to people like David- Peters work partner for not listening to them when they were trying to warn me about Peters laziness and drinking and lies.</strong></em></p>
            <p><em><strong>&nbsp;</strong></em></p>
            <p><em><strong>I told peter if I was making this chat client on my own I would of used C++ or at least a good C based language based like C# or even VB.net and I would of had it completed within 1 year at the most, we are going into the 5th&nbsp;year in the VCA project and we haven’t even really started yet and its in visual basic 6 so we were fucked from the start and I should of known this before starting the project and putting in money and time into it, even the 12 year old children I was gaming with on Minecraft said that visual basic 6 is old and the wrong language to use.</strong></em></p>
            <p><em><strong>Peter will say he will do something when he is drunk and then when he is sober he can’t be bothered to do anything but try find money to get drunk again, he will lie telling people he is working when he is not, he just has a hangover.</strong></em>
                <br>
                <em><strong> After nearly 5 years of broken promises telling me he was going to do this and that in the vca project I finally cracked and though fuck this Not anymore.</strong></em>
                <br>
                <em><strong> Its not just me Peter lets down its the users of the chat client as well.</strong></em></p>
            <p><em><strong>&nbsp;</strong></em></p>
            <p><em><strong>I kept asking Peter to finish the chat client so I can start advertising but nothing happened or if it did it was very small and buggy, after so many years of me asking, Peter started to block me on facebook and skype so I couldn’t keep asking him to do some work with me and of course that started making me pissed off.</strong></em></p>
            <p><em><strong>&nbsp;</strong></em></p>
            <p><em><strong>Peter told me so many times he was going to stop drinking and I always tried to help by giving my support and even giving him money when he kept telling me his kids were sick and needed money.</strong></em>
                <br>
                <em><strong> Then I would find out he was lying &nbsp;and was drinking all the time, I always hoped that I could help him and VCA would one day have been big enough to get money out of but I told him I cant market something that is not even finished.</strong></em></p>
            <p><em><strong>&nbsp;</strong></em></p>
            <p><em><strong>Because I use to drink I knew how drunks thought so I started to confront Peter on his lies and call him out on his company Paysoft and that’s when the blocking started but for years I always gave him the benefit of the doubt.</strong></em>
                <br>
                <em><strong> I asked him for the last time by email today saying I was pissed off because of what he has done or has not done to VoiceChatAlpha and he said this —&gt;</strong></em></p>
            <p><em><strong><a href="img/Pewees-last-words-300x72.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-9" src="img/Pewees-last-words-300x72.png" alt="Pewees last words" width="300" height="72"></a></strong></em></p>
            <p><em><strong>&nbsp;</strong></em></p>
            <p><em><strong>Hence why I made this page, I wanted to tell the story behind it all and why it went down, I am not ashamed of whats happened because I haven’t done anything wrong, all I wanted to do is make the worlds best chat client so everyone could experience the benefits of a chat client, connecting everyone around the world to learn of one another.</strong></em>
                <br>
                <em><strong> But I know who will be ashamed of them self’s when they see this page, Peter Gransden the drunk who lied even to his own brother to get money or to get attention.</strong></em></p>
            <p><em><strong>&nbsp;</strong></em></p>
            <p><em><strong>For those of you who want parts of the old Minecraft server give me an email on&nbsp;voicechatalpha@gmail.com&nbsp;and I will link it to you.</strong></em></p>
            <p><em><strong>&nbsp;</strong></em></p>
            <p><em><strong>I wont be running any gaming servers for a wile as I will be taking a rest from chat clients and gaming but I will save all the stuff from all the servers.</strong></em></p>
            <p><em><strong>&nbsp;</strong></em></p>
            <p><em><strong>Maybe one day I will make a new Chat client on my own <img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="😉" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f609.png"></strong></em>
                <br>
                <em><strong> But I will miss you all who came and went in the VoiceChatAlpha project.</strong></em>
                <br>
                <em><strong> Until next time this is Anton going for now and I shall catch up soon.</strong></em></p>
            <p><em><strong>&nbsp;</strong></em></p>
            <p><em><strong>Take care xoxox <img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="😉" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f609.png"></strong></em></p>
            <p><em><strong>&nbsp;</strong></em></p>
            <p><em><strong>P.S Fuck You Peter Gransden !!! You Idiot !!!</strong></em></p>
